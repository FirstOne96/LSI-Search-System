A_reduced stores the reduced matrix after SVD.
After applying SVD, the matrix no longer contains individual words, but instead latent topics.
The number of components (n_components) is a hyperparameter that can be tuned.
Latent Topics are abstract concepts or themes that represent relationships between words.
Each document is now represented by a combination of these topics, rather than individual word frequencies.
Instead of saying "this document contains 'AI', 'machine learning', 'data'", we now say "this document is 80% 
about Topic_1 and 20% about Topic_2".
